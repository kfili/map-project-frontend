### Description of app:
TL;DR: Find smoke free restaurants, cafes and bars easily! For the many countries where there is still smoking in public places.

In the city I grew up in, it can be tricky to find bars and restaurants that are
non-smoking. This is actually a real problem in most countries in the world. In
the current version my app has CRUD functionality that interfaces with a back
end that I built using Rails. My project idea is to ultimatly use google maps
API to map out all the smoke free restaurants so that non-smokers, and also
smokers who don't want the temptation, can find smoke free restaurants with
nice, clean, breathable air.

### Approach taken to building this app:

I approached tasks and built the app in the following order:
1) HTML - get a map showing.
2) Set up back end and get user authentication working.
3) Build Places Table.
4) Set up Places controller so users own their own data.
5) Get tables linked.

### Improvements for future versions:

- make Places appear on map.
- getting stuck in the map and not able to scroll up to see the nav bar.
- rename front end repo so that gh-pages URL is nice.
- map should center on user-IP-address location on page load.
- users add a more detailed smoke-free rating for places, in a separate modal.
- add 

### User Stories:

I am a user and I want to:
||  search for smoke free restaurants.
||  find smoke free restaurants on a map.
||  add a restaurants to the map.
||  add ratings (how clean the air inside is generally)
