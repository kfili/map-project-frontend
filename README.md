### Description of app:
Find smoke free restaurants, cafes and bars easily! For the many countries where there is still smoking in public places.

In the city I grew up in it can be tricky to find bars and restaurants that are
non-smoking. In fact close to half of the world population lives in countries
where there is smoking inside buildings open to the public. In the current
version my app has CRUD functionality that interfaces with a back end I built in
Rails. My project idea is to ultimatly use google maps API to map out all the
smoke free restaurants so that non-smokers, and smokers too, can find smoke free
restaurants with a nice atmosphere.

### Approach taken to building this app:

I approached tasks and built the app in this order:
1) HTML - get a map showing.
2) Set up back end and get user authentication working.
3) Build Places Table.
4) Set up Places controller so users own their own data.
5) Get tables linked.

### Improvements for future versions:

- make Places appear on map.
- getting stuck in the map and not able to scroll up to see the nav bar.
- rename front end repo so that gh-pages URL is nice.
- map should center on user-IP-address location on page load.
- users enter smoke-free rating in a separate modal.

### User Stories:

I am a user and I want to:
||  search for smoke free restaurants.
||  find smoke free restaurants on a map.
||  add a restaurants to the map.
||  add ratings (how clean the air inside is generally)
